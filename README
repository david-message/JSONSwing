JSONSwing implements Swing Based Editor tools including a JTree based control 
that can be embedded in other swing applications to enable viewing and editing
JSON with a point and right click edit metaphor. Values are updated with a 
simple property dialog. Also included is a complete JSON Edit dialog that can
be invoked to view and optionally modify JSON using the JTree control as well
as providing the ability to grab snippets of JSON from the object model.
